# Automated Reasoning in First Order Logic

This site contains the documentation for the Calcolemus library.

Calcolemus is a porting in F# of the code from John Harrison's [Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/index.html) written in OCaml and already ported in F# by [Jack Pappas](https://github.com/jack-pappas), [Eric Taucher](https://github.com/EricGT), [Anh-Dung Phan](https://github.com/dungpa) (see https://github.com/jack-pappas/fsharp-logic-examples).

Calcolemus is a fork of the [previous porting](https://github.com/jack-pappas/fsharp-logic-examples) with some changes.

The code contains lexer, parsing and printing for propositional and first order logic together with a wide range of theorem proving techniques both automated and with interaction human-machine.

The following namespaces are available:

* [Calcolemus](./reference/Calcolemus.html) - The main namespace with the specific thematics.

* [Calcolemus.Lib](./reference/Calcolemus-lib.html) - The library with basic functions for general implementation.
